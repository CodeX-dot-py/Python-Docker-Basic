Hello it's just a beginner's introduction to Python-Docker.

Step 1: First you need to install the Docker Desktop application in your pc. 

Step 2: Then go to the directory where you saved this git repository.

Step 3: Run the following Docker commands

        docker build --tag <Image name> . [like: docker build --tag my_first_image .]
        docker run <Image name>           [Like: docker run my_first_image]
